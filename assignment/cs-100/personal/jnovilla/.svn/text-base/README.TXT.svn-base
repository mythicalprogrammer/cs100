1st version of the circuit simulator.
takes a input file as the 2nd parameter of the arugment commands

and outputs solely to the console b/c i wasnt sure whether or not to make 
it output to the console or to an output file.

seems to work just fine but i was unable to test for the NOT gates 
due to a lack of time for testing.

have a nice day.
